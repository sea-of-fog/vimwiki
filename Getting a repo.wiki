= Getting a repo =

There are two ways to get a git repo.

== Cloning a repo ==
Type `git clone repo_url`. A directory for the repository is created, its name is by default the repo name. A different name needs to be passed: `git clone repo_url repo_local_dir`.

== Creating a repo ==
A repository can be created from an existing directory. To do this:
1. cd into the directory.
2. type `git init`.
3. add files and commit.
