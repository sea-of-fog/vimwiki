= Filesystem Management =

See [[Filesystem(software)]] for fs details. Every navigatory command can use either a _relative path_ or an _absolute path_.

== Navigation ==
* *_pwd_* stands for "print working directory"
* *_cd_* stands for "change directory", takes a path
    * *_cd .._* moves up a dir in the FS
    * *_cd_* goes to the user $HOME directory
* *_pushd /path_*, *_popd_* are used to manage the terminal directory stack

== Managing files ==
* *_mkdir /path/to/new/dir_* creates a directory
    * *_mkdir -p /path_* creates intermediate dirs as neede
        * Example: if there is no _~/Mar_, *_mkdir ~/Mar/Głow_* will return an error, but *_mkdir -p ~/Mar/Głow_* will create _~/Mar_ and _~/Mar/Głow_
* *_touch /path/to/new/file_* creates a file
* *_cp /old/path /new/path_* copies a file
    * *_cp -r /old/dir /new/dir_* copies directories
* *_rm /file/1 /file/2 ..._* removes files
    * *_rm -r /path_* recursively removes everything under _/path_

== Viewing ==
* *_ls_* lists files is _$PWD_.  Some options:
    * *_ls -a_* lists all files(including dotfiles, which are normally excluded)
    * *_[[ls -l]]_*
