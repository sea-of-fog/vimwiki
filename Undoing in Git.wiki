== Add to commit ==
If, after committing, you want to make additional changes and/or change the commit message
1. Make the changes, stage files etc.
2. Type `git commit --amend` and enter the new message.

The old commit is then *completely replaced*, as if it never existed.
Remember to *never amend commits pushed to remotes*.

== Unstage a file ==
Type `git reset HEAD /path/to/file`.

== Unmodifying a file ==
Type `git checkout -- /path/to/file`.
