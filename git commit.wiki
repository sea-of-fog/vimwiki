== Commit message ==
Every commit must include a message, which cannot be empty.
By default, core.editor will be opened to enter the commit message.
To specify on the command line, type:
`git commit -m "the commit message"`

== Skipping the index ==
The _staging area_ can be skipped by using:
`git commit -a`
This command stages and commits all modified files.
