Let's split it:

Type indicator - permissions - hardlinks - owner - grp owner - size - last modification date - name

== Type indicator ==
"-" for files, "d" for dirs

== Permissions ==
Permissions are listed in three blocks:
    1. For the owner.
    2. For the group.
    3. For others.
Each block tells whether the item can be read("r"), written("w") or executed("x").
Use [[Changing permissions]] to change permissions.

== Owner & Group Owner ==
A file can be assigned to a particular user and/or group. The owner need not be a member of said group.
Use [[chown]] to change (group) ownership or [[chgrp]] for just droup ownership only.
