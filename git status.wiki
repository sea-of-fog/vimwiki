= git status = 

The main command for seeing the current state of the files is `git status`.

== Double M ==
If a file is modified after being staged, `git status` will display it as *both* staged and unstaged.

== Shortened ==
`git status -s` or `git status --short` displays a shortened status list. Symbols appearing next to filenames:

| Symbol | Meaning                            | 
|--------|------------------------------------|
| "M "   | modified, staged                   |
| " M"   | modified, unstaged                 |
| MM     | modified, staged and then modified |
| A      | new file, staged                   |
| ??     | untracked                          |

Symobls appear in two columns. The left column represents the staging area while the right column represents the working tree.
