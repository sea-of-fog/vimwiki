= .gitignore =

Git has the option to completely ignore some files in its directory - that is, not even show them as unstaged.
The ignored files are specified in the `repo/.gitignore` file.

Rules for parsing `.gitignore`:
1. lines starting with `#` or blank are ignored
2. [[globbing]] is expanded
3. patterns starting with `/` are not expanded
4. patterns ending with `/`
5. `!` negates previous rules
