= Bash basic syntax =

== Interpretation ==
Bash scripts are not compiled. Instead they are interpreted as if run by a user.

== Shebang ==
As every interpreted script, a Bash script should start with a shebang. 
`#! /path/to/bash/interpreter`
The path can be found by running `which bash`.

== Comments ==
Bash comments begin with a `#`. End-of-line comments are supported, so:
`echo $variable     # comment here`
is a valid way to comment.

== Variables ==
Declare variables with:
`var=value`
No type specification is required.
The variable can be accessed with `$var`.
If something longer/with numbers/with [] has to be accessed, one can use `${name}`.
