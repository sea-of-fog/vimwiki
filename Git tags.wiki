= Git tags =

Tags are descriptions to specific moments in repo history.
There are two kinds of tags, and the annotated tags should be preferred.

== Lightweight tags ==
Can be described as a "static branch".
Lightweight tags generally just denote specific commits.

== Annotatted tags ==
Annotated tags are stored in the Git DB. They contain the identity of the commiter, the commit date, a message and may be signed with GPG.

For managing tags, see [[git tag]].
