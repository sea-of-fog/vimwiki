= Git: the three states =
See also [[Git files]]. This note concerns only _tracked files_.

- unmodified: consistent with git data
- modified: file has been changed, but Git "does not see" the change 
- staged: change marked to be committed to the DB
- committed: change remembered in the Git DB, this is the same as unmodified

== The three areas ==
Thus, the repo has three main parts:
- the working tree: where the files are
- the staging area(technically index): file listing what should be included in the next commit 
- the .git directory: where Git stores the magic(DB, metadata) 

== The tripartite workflow ==
Generally, a Git workflow can be described as:
1. modifying(rewriting, adding, deleting etc.) files the _working tree_
2. staging the changes that need be committed
3. committing
The staging area can be bypassed. See [[git commit#Skipping the index]].
